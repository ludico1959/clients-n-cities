## üíª Run locally
---
If you want to run the project on your local machine, just follow the steps below:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting...

To get started, you simply need to clone the project repository on your machine and install the dependencies.

```
  git clone https://github.com/ludico1959/clients-n-cities
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

Before installing the dependencies from the project, you need to have already installed on your machine:

* **Node.Js**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **Docker**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Instaling dependencies

Open cmd.exe your command-line interpreter and enter the path of your project. Then just type the following instruction: 

```
npm install
```

By typing the statement above, it will automatically download all the dependencies listed in the package.json file inside the folder **node_modules**:

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting ormconfig variables

For using and creating tables in the Postgres database on your Docker container, you must set the ormconfig variables. But don't worry, it's very easy! There's a file called ormconfig.example.json in the root of the folders project. There, you can edit the variables as you like and than rename it to **ormconfig.json**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the application

Well, now on the same cmd.exe screen (or another command-line interpreter), just start the server for the project to run locally typing:

```
node src/app/server.js
```

##  üì¨  Using the application 
---
I will put here two options for using this API: 

### üßÆ SWAGGER UI
The first one, using Swagger UI, is more user friendly. To use it, just type the following route in the seach bar of your favorite brownser!

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/api-docs/
```

### üìÆ  POSTMAN
The second one is not so user friendly, so I strong recommeded using the Swagger UI option above. But, as long as I was using Postman while I was creating the endpoints, I think it is valid to keep it and even a similar program called Insomnia as options. 
For using it, just import the **postman_collection.json** from inside the test folder. 

* **Postman**: [download here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
* **Insomnia**: [download here](https://insomnia.rest/download).
